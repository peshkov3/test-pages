        <p>The Raspberry Pi Foundation started by a handful of volunteers in 2012 when they released the original Raspberry Pi 256MB Model B without knowing what to expect. &nbsp;In a short four-year period they have grown to over sixty full-time&nbsp;employees&nbsp;and have shipped over <b>eight million</b> units to-date. &nbsp;Raspberry Pi has achieved new heights by being shipped to the&nbsp;International&nbsp;Space Station for research and by being an affordable computing platforms used by teachers throughout the world. &nbsp;"It has become the all-time best-selling computer in the UK".</p>

        <p>Raspberry Pi Foundation is charity organization that pushes for a digital revolution with a mission to inspire kids to learn by&nbsp;creating computer-powered objects. &nbsp;The foundation also helps teachers learn computing &nbsp;skills through free training and readily available tutorials &amp; example code for creating cool things such as music.</p>

        <p>In celebration of their 4th year&nbsp;anniversary, the foundation has released&nbsp;<b>Raspberry Pi 3</b> with the same price tag of<b>&nbsp;</b>$35 USD. &nbsp;The 3rd revision features a <b>1.2GHz 64-bit quad-core</b>&nbsp;ARM CPU with integrated Bluetooth 4.1 and 802.11n wireless LAN chipsets. &nbsp;The ARM Cortex-A53 CPU along with other architectural enhancements making it the fastest Raspberry Pi to-date. &nbsp;The 3rd revision is reportedly about 50-60% times faster than its predecessor Raspberry Pi 2 and about 10 times faster then the original Raspberry PI.</p>
        <p class="media-caption">Raspberry Pi - Various Usage</p>
        <p>Raspberry Pi 3 is now available via many online resellers. &nbsp;At this time, you should use a recent <b>32-bit </b>NOOBS or Raspbian image from their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">downloads</a> page with a promise of a switch to a 64-bit version only if further investigation proves that there is indeed some value in moving to 64-bit mode.</p>
