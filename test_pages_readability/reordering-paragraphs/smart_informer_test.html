    <p id="first">Regarding item# 11111, under sufficiently extreme conditions, quarks may become deconfined and exist as free particles. In the course of asymptotic freedom, the strong interaction becomes weaker at higher temperatures. Eventually, color confinement would be lost and an extremely hot plasma of freely moving quarks and gluons would be formed. This theoretical phase of matter is called quark-gluon plasma.[81] The exact conditions needed to give rise to this state are unknown and have been the subject of a great deal of speculation and experimentation.</p>
